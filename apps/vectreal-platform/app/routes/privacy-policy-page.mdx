### Personal information you disclose to us

***In Short:*** ***We collect personal information that you provide to us, which is stored and managed using Supabase infrastructure.***

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide when you **register** (authentication handled via **Supabase**), express interest in our products/Services, participate in activities, or contact us.

**Social Media Login Data:** We may provide options to register/log in using third-party social media accounts, specifically **Google**. If you choose this, **Supabase Auth** facilitates the connection, and we receive certain profile information from **Google**. This typically includes your **name, email address, profile picture, and other info you choose to make public via Google**. We use this info only for purposes described in this notice or otherwise stated. **We do not control and are not responsible for other uses by Google**. Review Google's privacy notice.

This is needed for security, operation (leveraging **Cloudflare** infrastructure), internal analytics, and reporting.

**Crucially, to protect against bots and abuse, we use Cloudflare Turnstile, an invisible CAPTCHA service.** When you interact with parts of our site protected by Turnstile, **Cloudflare automatically collects certain information** about your browser, device, and interaction patterns to verify you are human. This processing is handled by Cloudflare according to their privacy policy.

Like many businesses, we also collect information through **cookies and similar technologies**.
