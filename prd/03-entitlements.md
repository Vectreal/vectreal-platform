# Entitlements

_Feature capability matrix keyed by plan. An entitlement is a boolean grant — a feature is either available (`✓`) or not (`✗`) for a given plan._

## Entitlement Keys

Each row defines a canonical **entitlement key** used in feature-flag checks, API guards, and UI gating.

### Core Publishing

| Entitlement key | Description | `free` | `pro` | `business` | `enterprise` |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `scene_upload` | Upload 3D scenes | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `scene_optimize` | Run optimization pipeline | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

| `scene_preview_private` | Share private preview link | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `scene_version_history` | Access version history | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

`scene_embed` remains guarded at runtime: external embeds require a valid API key token, while internal preview access requires authenticated session access.

## Entitlement Resolution Logic

```text
hasEntitlement(orgId, entitlementKey):
  1. Resolve org's current plan (considering billing state)
  2. If billing state blocks access → return false  (see Billing States doc)
  3. Look up entitlement key in plan_entitlements map
  4. Check for org-level overrides (enterprise add-ons) → merge
  5. Return resolved boolean
```

## Billing-State Interaction

Some billing states restrict entitlements even if the plan would normally grant them. See [Billing States](./04-billing-states.md) for the authoritative state-to-access mapping.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Confirm whether `embed_branding_removal` should also be available on annual `free` plan.
- [ ] Define granularity for `org_roles` — is viewer-only a paid seat?
- [ ] Decide if `embed_ar_mode` requires a separate add-on or is bundled with `pro`.
